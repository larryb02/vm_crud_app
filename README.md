### Goal/Purpose
Since I am regularly working with lifecycle management software (VMWare VCenter, RedHat Satellite), I decided I want to create my own version of what [Foreman](https://theforeman.org/) has.  

## Steps:
### 1. Create webserver/ui
- Create webpages
    - home page: dashboard 
        - general view of all hosts, and other data as functionality gets extended
    - detailed host view page, 
    - login page, 
    - account info page
- Setup server
### 2. Backend
- Routing
- REST api
- Setup database
- Setup authentication logic
### 3. Virtualization stuff...
- write program to create virtual machines...
