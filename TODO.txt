TODO (Not in any specific order):
1. Create responsive buttons
    - Menu Pane
        - for now just create empty pane, will add items later
    - Account Info button
        - if signed in show a menu with basic info and a few buttons
        - if signed out show a menu telling user to sign in
2. Create Host View Page
    2a. Also create a detailed hosts page
        - idea is once on this page if user clicks on a host direct them to a detailed view of these hosts
In Progress:
3. Dynamically render text for "Host" table 
    3a. add a limit to data generation (should only grab 'n' number of hosts)
    - (eventually will change to "All" tables)
